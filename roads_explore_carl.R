# This doesn't really square with the results of Strano et al.

# I don't know, how the mean of the betweenness centrality can decrease, when a deadend edge (and the attibuted vertices) is removed 
# or bridged (to avoid 2-edge vertices). 
# Maybe I understand their formula wrong, and they actually only use the absolute difference - which wouldn't make too much sense I think...
